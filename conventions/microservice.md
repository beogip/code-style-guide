### Graphql
* Keep all logic of graphql inside the folder `src/graphql`
#### Resolvers
* Create one file per resolver
* Import the pipes using the path `../pipes`. Avoid to call pipes directly ~`../pipes/some-pipe-name.js`~
#### Types
* Create one file per type
### Filters
* Create one file per filter function
### Pipes
* Create one file per action entity. ie: `create-item.js`
### Tests
* Create one file per file to test.
* Use this schema for naming `{file-to-test-name}.spec.js`
## Code
### Filters
* Do only one thing, and do it well.
* Check for needed params, and throw error if someone is missing. Example
```javaScript
if (!_.has(user, 'id')) return reject(errors.handle('#missingUserId'))
```
* Always receives an object and returns another object (`{}` is a valid object) or a Promise.
* Don't use anonymous functions for process.

### Pipes

* For read actions always return arrays. ie: `findItems() => [item, item, item]` `findItemsById([id]) => [item]`

### Tests

* Test for `ok`, `undefined`, `null` & `invalid`.
* Test description must be
```javaScript
describe(Action)
    describe(command)
        it('Main action. Expect '
        ...
```
* Always catch for errors to prevent fails for timeout.
* Use `function(done) {` at `it( '', function(done){`. Read Mocha docs for further information.
